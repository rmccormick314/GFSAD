# GFSAD
Crop type and crop intensity mapping using HLSL30 and CDL data for the GFSAD30 project.

---

## Crop Intensity
This module focuses on analyzing crop growth cycles to determine the number of harvestable crop cycles within a year. Using temporal and spatial data from HLSL30 and CDL, this process identifies crop intensity patterns.

## Crop Type
This module maps different crop types within a region using neural network classification techniques applied to HLSL30 and CDL datasets.

## Preprocessing (WIP)
The preprocessing step includes.

## Utilities (WIP)
This section provides additional tools and scripts.

### Data Sources
- **HLSL30**: Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data at 30-meter resolution.
- **CDL**: Cropland Data Layer providing annual crop-specific land cover.
